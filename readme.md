# Sort Notes

Creating a easy to create and sort platform for my own notes but also so other users can create their own account and help orgnaise their work.

## Features To Implement

#### Click and drag

I need to add a click and drag feature to allow the user to rearrange their notes.

#### Adding data, styles

  - Lifting record, A form need to be added to format a lifting record

  - Image and video, An image says a thousand words so this might help the user save some time and save more information.

  - Some Graphs?..

## Left to do

The navigation needs to be added, using the fields and subjects that the user has created.

I also need to host the static files on AmazonAWS for the images and videos to be saved.

## Bugs

When adding data to the modal data the user can submit the form with no 'Note Style' selected. I'll need to use js to fix this.
