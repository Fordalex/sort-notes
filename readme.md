# Sort Notes

Creating a easy to create and sort platform for my own notes but also so other users can create their own account and help orgnaise their work.

## Features To Implement

#### Click and drag

I need to add a click and drag feature to allow the user to rearrange their notes.


## Bugs

When adding data to the modal data the user can submit the form with no 'Note Style' selected. I'll need to use js to fix this.
